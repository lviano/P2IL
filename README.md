***Implementation for Proximal Point Imitation Learning***

The expert trajectories used during the experiments can be found here: **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACP1QIqJ4KjBvwSqsyPEK5BoclueWCyx?usp=sharing**

Place the folder **LinearMDPs** in the folder **linear_PPIL/expert_trajs/** and the folder MDPs in the folders **offline_PPIL/experts/** and **deep_PPIL/experts/**


The folder **linear_PPIL** contains the code for reproducing the experiments in Linear MDPs. The folder **deep_PPIL** contains instead the code for experiments with neural network function approximation.

Finally, the folder **offline_PPIL** contains the code for the offline version.
